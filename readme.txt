== Description ==

The Registrations for The Events Calendar plugin is an extension for Modern Tribe's The Events Calendar (free edition).

Create a custom contact form that is revealed on a click on the single event post in a location of your choosing.

The form is submitted without leaving the page using AJAX.

Notification emails are sent to email addresses of your choosing as well as the form submitter. Details of the submission are saved in a custom table in the WordPress database.

Just about everything in the form is customizable including the text, required fields, registration limits, and the email messages.

= Can I limit the number of registrations for an event? =

Yes. You can set up the maximum number of registrants on the "Form" tab

It's likely that you have a javascript error somewhere on that page. Try disabling other plugins or switching themes to see i this corrects the issue.
